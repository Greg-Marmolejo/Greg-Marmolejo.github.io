                <p>I'm learning to be a web developer after a 22 year long career in Telecommunications.</p>
                <p>I've worked on several software implementations, inventories, and in quality assurance.</p>
                <p>I'm a good team player and an effective communicator, but most importantly I'm excited to be starting a new career!</p>
                <p>I'm also passionate about music. I'm a singer/songwriter/guitarist, and I play in a reggae band and a country band here in Austin.</p>
